    "* **Random Variable:** a numerical quantity whose value is determined by the outcome of the probabilistic experiment (e.g. the weight of a randomly selected person)\n",
    "  * Abstract concept of weight: $\\mathbf{W}$ (random variable)\n",
    "  * Particular weight of given student: $\\mathbf{w}$ (actual number)\n",
    "  * Weight is an object whose value is determined once the outcome of the prob. experiment is known\n",
    "  * Can think of Weight ($W$) as black box/function: $student \\to \\mathbf{W} \\to w$\n",
    "  * Possible for a given probabilistic experiment to have multiple associated random variables (e.g. weight W, height H, etc.)\n",
    "    * Create new random variable based off other random variables, e.g. $BMI = B = \\frac{W}{H^2}$ (still a function of outcomes)\n",
    "  * Random variables are functions mapping $\\Omega$ to real numbers (discrete or continuous values)\n",
    "      * Meaning of $X + Y$: random variable takes value $x + y$, where X takes value x and Y takes value y given some outcome\n",
    "  * Since some of the outcomes of a probabilistic experiment are more likely than others, the associated numerical values of random variables will be more likely than others  \n",

    "* **Probability Mass Functions (PMF, Probability Law or Probability Distribution):** description of relative likelihoods for values of random variable\n",
    "  * Define the y-axis of a PMF for random variable X, $p_X(x) = P(X=x) = P(\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega\\ such\\ that\\ X(\\omega)=x\\})$\n",
    "    * $PMF = f(x)$, where for any x, the PMF specifies the probability that the random variable X takes on this particular value x\n",
    "  * Properties:\n",
    "    * $p_X(x) \\geq 0$ (like any probability)\n",
    "    * $\\sum\\limits_{x}p_X(x)=1$\n",

    "    * Determine sample space and probability rule (e.g. 2 fair dice rolls $\\to$ 4x4 grid where each outcome has probability $\\frac{1}{16}$)\n",
    "    * Determine random variable (e.g. Z = sum of 2 dice rolls)\n",
